刷几遍[LeetCode](https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/)来恶补下面试算法题。
#题目
1. [Two Sum](#TwoSum)




<h4 id="TwoSum">Two Sum</h4>

>Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

>The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2. Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.

>You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

>Input: numbers={2, 7, 11, 15}, target=9
Output: index1=1, index2=2 

解法：最普通的解法就是两层循环遍历，但是会`O($n^2$)`会超时。可以先将数组中数和索引存到HashMap中，然后再遍历查找。
